We have re-architected or refactored the services of our application workload that used to run on different types of machines (physical, virtual, or cloud). We have migrated to AWS cloud services that are more agile, scalable, and cost-effective than our previous infrastructure. We have deployed our application on EC2 instances using Beanstalk service, which provides load balancing and auto scaling features. We have also switched to RDS for database, Elasticache for caching, ActiveMQ for messaging, Route 53 for DNS, and CloudFront for content delivery network. We have leveraged the benefits of infrastructure as code, platform as a service, and software as a service to reduce our operational overhead and improve our performance of our application workload.
